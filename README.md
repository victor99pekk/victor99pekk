# 👋 Hi, I’m Armon Haghighi

🎓 I’m a Master’s student in **Machine Intelligence** at Lund University, Sweden.  
🌍 Currently on exchange at **UC San Diego**, Studying Mahcine learning and Mathematics, and reserching reasoning in LLMs in the Labratory for Emerging intelligence at UCSD

🧪 I’m working as a research assistant on **reasoning in large language models (LLMs)**.  
🛫 This summer, I’ll be joining **Neo4j** as a Machine Learning Intern in Sweden.
