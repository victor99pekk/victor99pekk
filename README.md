# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victor Pekkari

Hi, Iâ€™m a MSc student in **Machine Intelligence** at `Lund University`, `UC San Diego`, and I software engineer at `Neo4j`.

I am currently looking for full time job in the field of machine learning, software engineering, data science to start in fall 2026.


## ðŸ”¬ What Iâ€™m Interested In

- ðŸ¤– Deep learning for **combinatorial optimization**\
  
  I recently completed a big reserach study in novel approaches with machine learning for finding the NP-hard problem maximum cut of a graph. [`[Link]`](https://github.com/victor99pekk/ML_4_MAXCUT)
- ðŸ“Š **Machine learning systems**: compilation, quantization, performance tuning

    I am interested to all applications of ML, and like to to little experiment projects myself where i try to implement `ML-systems` from the ground up. One example of this is a Neural network library in C that i coded with nothing but the standard C lirbaries. [`[Link]`](https://github.com/victor99pekk/c_neural_network), or an exploratio in LLMs where i impemented a text classifier [`[Link]`](https://github.com/victor99pekk/invoice_handler) 

- ðŸ§  **LLM reasoning** 
  
  I was in a research group called the Lab of emerging intelligence at UC San Diego were we studied reasoning in LLMs, it is still something I am very interested in.
